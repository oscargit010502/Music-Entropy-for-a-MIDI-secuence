# Music-Entropy-for-a-MIDI-secuence
For the final project of Fundamentals of Acoustics course for my Sound Engineering degree.

The purpose of this project is to calculate the music entropy value for a MIDI melody file.

// NOTE: this program only works for unidimensional MIDI melody files (chords not included).

it contains:
☑️ Assets (icon images, MIDI files with music genres)
☑️ Source code in Python (Jupyter Notebook)
